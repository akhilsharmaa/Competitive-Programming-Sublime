### My C++ basic template file - [template.sublime-snippet](https://github.com/akhilsharmaa/Competitive-Programming-SETUP/blob/main/akhilsharmaa.sublime-snippet)
 I suggest to take references from this and **try to create your own template** it will take time but worth.
    **You can find fancy template** of great coder but it take time to be at that level.
